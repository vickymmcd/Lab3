##How to run our test:
#This is an example for checking add immediate, other op codes and immediate variables can be added to check other functionality

#Upload all documents to Vivado as Design Resources
#Load ZYBO_Master.xdc as a Design Constraint
#Run Synthesis, Implementation, and Bitstream before programing the FPGA board
#Load the op-code with the switches and hit button0
#Load the immediate value with the switches and hit button1
#Observe the immediate value by pressing button2
#Observe the output of the ALU by pressing button3
